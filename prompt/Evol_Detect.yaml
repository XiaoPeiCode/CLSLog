  # Background
  As software evolves, developers continuously modify log statements to improve system maintainability and adaptability in new versions. 
  Log evolution: Minor changes have occurred in log entries and dependencies within the log sequence, but there has been no substantial change in the log semantics or the system state they represent.
  - Log entry evolution refers to changes in individual log messages after software updates, such as the addition of more descriptive details.
  - Log sequence evolution refers to changes in the order or dependencies among logs after software evolution.

  # Task
  Your task is to determine whether there is an evolutionary relationship between the current log sequence `evolution_after` and the log sequences `evolution_before_list` after software version updates, and provide corresponding reasoning.
  
  
  # Input Format
  - `file_system`: The system from which the logs originate.
  - `evolution_before`: The log sequence before evolution.
  - `evolution_after`: The current log sequence to determine if there is an evolutionary relationship.

  **Chain of Thought:**
  First, carefully analyze the differences between the two log sequences:
  1. Determine if `evolution_after` represents an abnormal state of the system. If it does, then there is no evolutionary relationship. If it represents a normal state, further analysis is needed.
  2. If only the content of the log entries has changed slightly (e.g., more descriptive details added) without altering their original "normal" or "abnormal" attributes, then an evolutionary relationship exists.
  3. If there are slight changes in the order or dependencies of log entries, or if entries are added or deleted but do not have substantial impact, an evolutionary relationship still exists.
  4. If there are significant changes in the order or dependencies of log entries, or if the semantics and system states represented by the logs differ, then no evolutionary relationship exists.

  # Input
  ## file_system
  {file_system}

  ## evolution_before
  {evolution_before}

  ## evolution_after
  {evolution_after}

  # Output
  Please return the result to me in the following JSON format:
  {{
    "IsEvol": "True/False", # Whether an evolutionary relationship exists
    "reason": "Please explain your reasoning process"  # Reasoning for determining the evolutionary relationship
  }}
